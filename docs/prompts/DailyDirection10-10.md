# Daily Direction

## User Query
```
so far I've setup the basic project in Cursor. both the client and server apps are up and running with placeholder content. It's a new day, and I'm trying to decide what to work on now. based on the components and recommended development order, what should I do today?

## Assistant Response

Based on the components and recommended development order outlined in your Components.md file, it seems like you've already made some initial progress by setting up the basic project structure for both the client and server. Given this, here's what I would recommend focusing on today:

1. Image Upload Service

This is the first component in the recommended development order, and it's a crucial foundation for the rest of the application. Here's what you could work on:

1. Create a basic frontend interface for image selection and upload in your client app.
2. Implement the server-side logic to handle file uploads.
3. Set up temporary storage for the uploaded images on the server.
4. Implement basic error handling and file validation (e.g., file type, size limits).

Here's a rough outline of tasks:

1. In the client app:
   - Create a file input component
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality (optional, but user-friendly)
   - Add a submit button to trigger the upload

2. In the server app:
   - Set up an endpoint to receive file uploads
   - Implement file handling logic (saving to disk or temporary storage)
   - Add basic file validation

3. Connect the client and server:
   - Implement the API call from the client to send files to the server
   - Handle and display upload progress and success/error messages on the client

By focusing on the Image Upload Service, you'll be laying the groundwork for the subsequent components. This service will interact with the Data Storage Service (the next component in the recommended order) and the Image Analysis Service later on.

Remember to keep the implementation relatively simple at this stage. You can always come back to add more advanced features (like handling multiple uploads or implementing more robust security measures) in later iterations.
