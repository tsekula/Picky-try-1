# Data Storage Service

## Overview
The Data Storage Service manages the storage and retrieval of user data, image data, metadata, and analysis results. It ensures data isolation between different user accounts.

## Challenges
- Designing an efficient schema for quick retrieval
- Implementing vector storage for semantic search capabilities
- Ensuring data isolation and security between user accounts

## Interactions
- Receives data from User Authentication, Image Upload, Image Analysis, and Facial Recognition Services
- Provides data to the Search Service and Gallery View Component

## Decisions to be made

1. **Database Type:**
   - Relational (e.g., PostgreSQL) vs. NoSQL (e.g., MongoDB)
   - Consider a hybrid approach with a relational DB for structured data and a document store for flexible metadata

2. **Vector Storage Solution:**
   - Choose a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Milvus) or vector extension for your primary database (e.g., pgvector for PostgreSQL)

3. **File Storage:**
   - Local file system vs. Cloud object storage (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage)
   - Consider factors like scalability, cost, and access speed

4. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Decide on a caching solution (e.g., Redis) for frequently accessed data

5. **Data Partitioning:**
   - Determine if/how to partition data (e.g., by user, date, or content type)

6. **Backup and Redundancy:**
   - Choose backup frequency and method
   - Decide on redundancy level (e.g., multi-region replication)

7. **Access Control:**
   - Define the authentication and authorization mechanism for data access
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for different user types

## Setup and Initialization

1. **Database Setup:**
   - Install and configure chosen database system(s)
   - Create necessary databases, tables, and indexes
   - Set up user accounts and access permissions

2. **Schema Design:**
   - Design and implement database schema for:
     - User accounts and authentication data
     - Image metadata (filename, size, dimensions, upload date, etc.)
     - Analysis results (objects, text, people, landmarks, scene labels)
     - Tagging and categorization system

3. **Vector Storage Integration:**
   - Set up chosen vector storage solution
   - Create necessary indexes for efficient similarity search

4. **File Storage System:**
   - Configure chosen file storage system
   - Set up access controls and security measures
   - Implement user-specific storage buckets or folders

5. **API Development:**
   - Create RESTful or GraphQL API endpoints for:
     - User account management
     - Storing new image data and metadata
     - Retrieving image data and metadata
     - Updating existing records
     - Performing vector similarity searches

6. **Data Migration (if applicable):**
   - Develop scripts to migrate existing data to the new system

7. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Set up monitoring tools for database performance
   - Implement logging for all data operations

8. **Backup System:**
   - Configure automated backups
   - Test backup and restore procedures

9. **Scaling Preparation:**
   - Set up database replication if needed
   - Configure load balancing for API servers

10. **Integration Testing:**
    - Develop and run integration tests with other services (User Authentication, Image Upload, Image Analysis, etc.)

11. **Documentation:**
    - Create comprehensive documentation for the Data Storage Service API
    - Document database schema and any special procedures

12. **Security Measures:**
    - Implement encryption for sensitive data
    - Set up firewalls and network security rules
    - Ensure proper data isolation between user accounts
